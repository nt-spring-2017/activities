# Lightning Talks

## Description

Lightning talks have becomes a very popular presentation format, especially in the world of programming (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk).

These presentations are very short (2-3 minutes) and are extemporaneous speech acts, which means that they involved some preparation, but you don't read from a script.
In some versions of lightning talks, you use a set number of slides, and you have a time limit for each slide. For our lightning talks, you are not required to use slides but, if you use them, you should use no more than ten and include only short titles for text (no script).

## Grading

If you stand up and give a talk, you get a 100%. Because, yay for you, you did it!

## Going over time

If you go long, a gong might sound, or loud music might play. Or maybe the sound of a cat meowing. It's hard to say.

## Some Topic Ideas

#### Give us the inside scoop on something cool about how a game was designed, marketed, sold, or received by audiences. 
#### Tell us all about a cool game that would be interesting to use in a future version of "Narrative and Technology"
#### Discuss some cool, as-of-yet uncovered aspect of one of the games we played for class 
#### Connect the dots in a new or intersting way between two apsects of the class, or an aspect of our class with one of our other classes
#### Discuss a recent news story that relates to the course's subject matter
