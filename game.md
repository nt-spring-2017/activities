# Game Design Unit Activities

## Inform 7 Tutorials

The programming Language Inform 7 will be a big part of how we conceptualize our game design unit and assignment. For Tuesday, March 14, make sure that you have watched at least two of the
the five videos from the "Learn Inform 7 Tutorial Series" by Dan Cox. Each video is about eight minutes long, so it will be possible to watch all five, as long as what's being discussed
makes sense to you. If you're finding it difficult to absorb the concepts discussed in the video, it would be preferable to watch only a couple videos but to review them
so that you really understand what's being addressed. You should also download and install Inform 7 so that you can follow along with the tutorials and replicate at least some of what is shown to you as you watch.
